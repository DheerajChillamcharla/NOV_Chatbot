# RAG Chat Bot for NOV

## Introduction 

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) question-and-answer chatbot specifically designed to deliver precise and relevant information about NOV’s products. The chatbot uses OpenAI models via API integration to effectively answer queries related to product details, brochures, flyers, catalogs, case studies, and more. By leveraging both retrieval and generation techniques, the bot ensures comprehensive and accurate responses, drawing from NOV’s extensive and openly available document library. This targeted approach provides a streamlined user experience, enabling efficient access to product-related information.
